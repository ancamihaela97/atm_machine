For this ATM application I used Java and SpringBoot, Maven for dependencies. As an IDE i used IntelliJ.
I created a memory database with H2 in order to save some accounts (card number, pin, current balance). I saved the pin
in plain view because it is a mock dataBase used to simulate an atm machine.
The basic functions are check balance and withdraw a sum of money, as well as the "login" with the credit card and pin.
I also used Thymeleaf, html and Bootstrap for the frontend part.
